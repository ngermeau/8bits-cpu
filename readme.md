# Minimalistic And Naive 8 Bit CPU Simulator 


# Todo

[ ] code cleanup  
[ ] let a program be passed in parameter   
[ ] take carry flag as input for add, shr, shl    
[ ] does other operations than CMP also affect the flags c,a,e,z ?     
[ ] the fact that execute instruction take steps 4,5,6 is not really correct   
[ ] exception for not moving acc to register in case of CMP not very clean   
[ ] computer (cycles) stop after program finish executing   
[ ] display graphical rendering of memory, regs...   
[ ] write a correct readme (supported instructions etc...)    
[ ] write your own assembly compiler   
[ ] take care of peripherals     


# Demo programs

- add: add two value 
- counter: increment r1 until value of r2 and then stop
